Video Experience

The intial step for setting up any sort of video was looking at vga and bios mode setting. I the looked at VESA mode setting and decided that VBE, the vesa spec, had everything that I would need. 

Steps:
1) I set the video mode to a mode with the specs I wanted.
2) I obtain the vesa mode info and the vga mode info and store them in the lower one meg of memory.
3) Then we switch to protected mode and access the static address in the lower one meg of memory.
4)
